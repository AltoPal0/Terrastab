Adapting to zero-click searches
Zero-click searches now account for 60% of Google queries, where users find answers directly in search results without visiting websites. 

This fundamental shift requires adapting content strategies to maintain visibility in featured snippets and knowledge panels while still driving valuable traffic.

The challenge is to provide enough information to be featured in these prominent positions while still giving users a reason to click through to your website for more detailed information.

Creating content for AI Overviews

AI Overviews display direct answers at the top of Google search results, capturing users’ attention before they see traditional organic listings. 

When targeting AI Overviews:

Structure content in a Q&A format using clear headings with questions as titles to optimize for these valuable positions.
Write concise 40- to 60-word answers summarizing key information while hinting at additional value on your website. 
Use bullet points, numbered lists, and tables to organize data in a way that’s easy for users and search engines to understand.
Include relevant statistics and facts supported by authoritative sources, which adds credibility to your content and increases the likelihood of being featured. 
Format content with proper HTML heading tags to help search engines identify the hierarchical structure of your information.
Research the specific questions your audience is asking about your topic. 
Look at People also ask boxes and related searches to identify opportunities to address common questions in your content.
